# Contracts

There are two ways of making a contract between two Obyte users: either to agree on some conditions and formalize them in our Smart Contract Language, which later can be evaluated by machine code and decide who spends the money from the contract \([Smart Contracts](https://github.com/tarmo888/developer-docs/tree/2373a467f30a8dcc24094fd31335ba946b5275e5/contracts/contracts/smart-contracts.md)\), or just publish a hash of simple prosaic text of a contract into DAG \([Prosaic Contracts](https://github.com/tarmo888/developer-docs/tree/2373a467f30a8dcc24094fd31335ba946b5275e5/contracts/contracts/prosaic-contracts.md)\).
